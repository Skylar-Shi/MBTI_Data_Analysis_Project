In addition, we would also like to use general attributes of individuals and posts in social media to predict individuals' personalities. We believe our question is well-posted since it does not contain any biased or discriminatory term. \n",

To deal with this possible issue of generalization, we may consider to also include data from other social media platforms or narrow down our question to only study Twitter users’ MBTI characteristics\n",

        "\n",
        "- Our Twitter dataset included 8,328 Twitter users who reported their MBTI personalities in their profile. Although we did not have informed consent from users, the profile information is publicly viewable and the data is self-reported. Thus, we believe the MBTI information on the public profile is usable. To ensure that all users’ privacies are protected, we will remove all users’ personally identifiable information such as usernames, screen names, and locations.\n",
        "- Since the data is self-reported, a possible bias is that people with certain MBTI personalities may be more likely to reveal their identity than others. Thus, the distribution of MBTIs in our data may not reflect the true distribution. \n",
        "\n",
        "### The Data \n",
        "\n",
        "- There is plentiful available data related to MBTI on social media. The data is closely related to our question, though we may need to combine some features (such as number of flowers, friends, and listed) to create measurement for user activity levels and extract useful keywords from posts to predict personalities.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Bias in Data\n",
        "The data may contain biases that exclude some populations: \n",
        "- Since our study focuses on each person's personality type using MBTI, it excludes people who didn't complete this test or are not aware of/not interested in receiving the MBTI test.\n",
        "- The main dataset we use investigates Twitter users. If we are not able to include additional datasets, it's biased to generalize it into \"social media platforms\" because users may be active on other platforms but not on Twitter. Also, older adults and those who are not familiar with such technology will be excluded.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis \n",
        "- We plan to conduct two types of analyses: inferential and predictive. During these processes, we want to test the association between certain personality traits in MBTI and people’s popularity on the social media platform. There may exist possible covariates such as people’s occupations and ages (which may affect users’ popularity), but since in each trait of the personality (e.g. E/I, S/N), this personal information should be evenly spread out, we don’t consider it as a confounding factor.\n",
        "- Another possible bias in the analysis is the uneven number of data across each trait(e.g. certain personality types may be more likely to test their MBTI and be included in the dataset). To counter such bias, we will use the same data size or calculate the mean/median for each group (E/I, S/N) to analyze.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Post-Analysis\n",
        "Once we complete our algorithm, we would make disclaimer about possible biases or stigmas (the results is not implying certain personality types are better than others). Also, we will track the data changes such as the amount of each trait being included and update our datasets if significantly more data is introduced. "
